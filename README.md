# Preface

DevOps usage can be found in many of the largest tech firms of today, but it application can be extended to businesses and projects of all sizes. It's rapid adoption is occurring for a good reason, helping businesses align their internal groups to focus on an item of work as a whole, instead of departmentalized, and it's success stemming from both psychological reasons founded in science and the upward movement from the people who have dealt with artificially imposed corporate structures.

**Who should read this book?**

I see a few types of people being interested in buying this book: project managers, software developers and testers, operations engineers, as well as execute and c-level management. This is a pretty wide array for an audience and gives me an challenging job of accommodating the various aspects people are interested in for DevOps. Some people want to get to the meat and potatoes of it all while others seek the scenic route of its origins, so I've tried to structure the contents of the book to be able to cater to the areas in particular readers would be interested in.

**How this book is organized**

Chapter 1, *Root Cause*

> This chapter walks through the various areas that customers are probably already encountering unless they've unknowingly started to grasp bits and pieces of the DevOps movement. The areas I've chosen here are not a complete list of issues that companies are facing, but it's the larger ones that seem to be the most daunting of them all. If you're able to overcome these hurdles, you'll have the skillsets to overcome any of the other issues that might be afflicting you.

Chapter 2, *History*

> Here we will cover how the DevOps movement actually got started, who pioneered the concept years before the term was coined, and who you should probably start following if you haven't already.

Chapter 3, *Concepts*

> The unfortunate part about DevOps is that it means something different to everyone and how it affected them, and that the usually have a hard time explaining what it is and is not. We'll call out what it isn't and what it really is, and attempt to tackle the concept using a few other familiar and established methodologies to drive home the idea. And every good idea comes with its skeptics and doubters, so we'll cover the criticisms that it's garnered as well.

Chapter 5, *Roadblocks*

> Another unfortunate part about DevOps is that someone like myself had to write a book to explain what it means, what has to change, and what you'll gain from it. Change is good, change is necessary, and change is inevitable, but not everyone can deal with that thought, so you will run into a few roadblocks along the way. This chapter will walk through the obvious ones, and the surprising ones that come from the same people who are championing for the cause along with you.

Chapter 4, *Framework*

> By this chapter, you should understand what got people riled up, what got them marching, and what the movement is all about should it come down your hall one day. But applying the principals behind DevOps can be an uphill battle. I'll provide some the industry's best advice on how to tackle the corporate politics to provide the necessary provide inertia to get your movement rolling.

Chapter 6, *Implementations*

> This chapter is all about the large tech companies I was referring to. Here, we'll attempt to dive into each of the company's unique challenges, what they chose to tackle first, and how the movements started there.
