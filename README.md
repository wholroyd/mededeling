# Introduction

DevOps usage can be found in many of the largest tech firms of today, but its application can be extended to businesses and projects of all sizes. It's rapid adoption is occurring for a good reason, helping businesses align their internal groups to focus on an item of work as a whole, instead of departmentalized, and it's success stemming from both psychological reasons founded in science and the upward movement from the people who have dealt with artificially imposed corporate structures.

The goal of this book is to cover the root causes of why and how DevOps became a movement in the first place, what it really is (as opposed to how companies have marketed it), and you can apply it to the problems your company is facing today.

# Progress

This book is currently a work in progress at the beginning of the writing process. As such, a lot of the goals and chapters defined for the book have not been completed or possibly started. If you are not comfortable with purchasing the book in it's current state, contact me for a preview of the book in it's current form.

It is also being entirely authored and edited by the same person, whom also happens to be entirely open to constructive criticisms, suggestions, and feedback for what is currently in the book and for what might come in future editions. Feel free to direct your concerns at me through email: william@holroyd.name or @william_holroyd on Twitter.
