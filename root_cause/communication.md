# Communication

Another way to view the DevOps movement, is that there are inherent communication issues between three main groups of service management – business, development, and operations. Each of these three groups communicate differently, which causes problems. As a result, you can view DevOps as an equivalent mechanism of Scrum that focuses on development and operation team’s communication; whereas Scrum focused on the business and development team’s communication.

* The implementation of Scrum fixes the business and development group’s communication by defining what features the business wants built, in order of importance, and allows the business to view the work required to complete it through spring planning and backlog grooming.

* The implementation of DevOps fixes the development and operations group’s communication by coordinating the processes, workflows, and goals to achieve a singular vision for the overall operation of a service through collaboration implemented by the elimination of organizational boundaries.
