# Workflows

The terminology most people would use here is 'silo'.

The disconnection of the teams comes from how each of the teams need to perform their deployments and the fact that whatever automated method is built by the development team usually gets dropped in favor of manual deployments. For some deployments, configurations are not considered code which means that some settings donâ€™t make it into an environment at deployment time, extending deployment times unnecessarily. Then there is that fact that problem area solutions are kept intra-product and not shared between platforms means that the company will often develop the same feature twice (or more).

With some changes to how and where source code is maintained, and small truly free ideas for signaling a positive change of the corporate culture, you can change that attitude and get people to become positive about the future and tear down some walls in the process (pulling for changes, instead of waiting for someone else to push).
